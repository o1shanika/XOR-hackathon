# 🧕 Problem Addressed: Challenges Faced by Sri Lankan Housemaids Abroad

Many Sri Lankan women migrate to Middle Eastern countries seeking better job opportunities as housemaids. Unfortunately, many of them face serious challenges that put their safety, well-being, and rights at risk. These challenges often go unreported or unresolved due to lack of access to immediate support systems.

## ⚠️ Key Problems

### 🚨 No Quick Access to Emergency Help  
In cases of abuse, accidents, or harassment, many Sri Lankan housemaids struggle to contact the embassy or someone trustworthy for immediate assistance.

### 🧠 Mental Stress and No One to Talk To  
Emotional distress is common among these workers, yet there's little to no access to mental health support in Sinhala or Tamil. Cultural stigma often prevents them from reaching out for help.

### 🌍 Lack of Connection with Fellow Sri Lankans  
Despite working in the same country, most Sri Lankan housemaids have no structured way to find or connect with one another, resulting in isolation and a lack of community.

## 📌 Sub-Problems

### 📜 Lack of Access to Real-Time Legal Updates  
Due to low digital literacy and poor information flow, many housemaids are unaware of local laws, visa regulations, or labor rights that directly impact them.

### 💱 No Access to Currency Exchange Information  
Managing earnings and remittances becomes difficult without real-time updates on currency exchange rates.
